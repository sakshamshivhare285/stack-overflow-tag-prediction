Stack Overflow Tag Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting relevant tags for Stack Overflow questions based on their title and body text. By accurately predicting tags, we can enhance the user experience by improving search results, recommending related questions, and facilitating question discovery.

The project involves:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature engineering
Model selection and training
Evaluation and performance metrics

Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
Data
The project uses a dataset of Stack Overflow questions with their corresponding tags. The data should be preprocessed and cleaned before use.

Usage
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Convert text data into numerical representations (e.g., using TF-IDF).
Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features from the preprocessed data.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
